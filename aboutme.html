         &emsp;&ensp;  One of the main words that comes to mind when I think about the photos for my portfolio is the word whimsy. 
        I love taking pictures that have a slight childish feel of imagination and magic to them. This is most apparent 
        in the pictures of the piglet in the tree, the frog prince, and my self portrait. While this idea is not as obvious
        in all of the photos, they all have a slight influence from it. For example: the birds. Birds to me are maybe the 
        most fascinating animals in nature. They freely fly through the air and their call sounds like music. Birds are by 
        far the most magical of any animal (sorry narwhals). I love the idea of enchanted forests and magical objects and this
        tends to come through in my photos. <br><br>
            After this semester, I'm able to feel more comfortable in my love of photography. Even before this semester, I've always 
        liked photography; I used to spend hours going through photo albums of old vacations and events. I had always wanted to be
        better at photography myself, but had never taken the time to do so. This course has allowed me to finally be able to take 
        the way I see them in my head. I look forward to years of capturing memories in the best way possible.
